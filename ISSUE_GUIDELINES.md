## Issue Management

In all cases please use the [GitHub open issue search](https://github.com/avantifellows/college-predictor/issues) to check whether the issue has already been reported.

### New Issues
To create new issues follow these steps:

1. Your issue may have already been created. Search for duplicate open issues before submitting yours, for similar deficiencies in the code - duplicate issues are created.
1. Verify whether the issue has been fixed by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch in the repository.
1. Click on the [`New Issue`](https://github.com/avantifellows/college-predictor/issues/new/choose) button
1. Use the templates to create a standardized report of what needs to be done and why.
1. If you want to be assigned the issue that you have created, then add a comment immediately after submitting it.

We welcome contributors who find new ways to make the code better.

### Feature Request Issues

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the mentors of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## General Guidelines

1. Discuss issues in the GitHub issue itself or GitHub discussion when necessary
2. Please do not derail or troll issues.
3. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
